  <!-- WORK IN PROGRESS -->

  <!-- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) may be embedded within HTML, so that's
    what we've done here in order to simplify what we need to do to see SVG
    in action. -->

  <!-- An SVG element.  Our visuals get rendered within here.  If any of our
    visuals runs up against the edge of our SVG element they'll get clipped. -->
  <svg width="500" height="500">

    <!-- A rectangle.  `x` and `y` specifies where the upper-left corner is. -->
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="50" />

    <!-- A circle.  `cx` and `cy` specifies where the circle centers
      around and `r` specifies the radius. -->
    <circle cx="250" cy="45" r="25" />

    <!-- An ellipse.  Each axis needs a separate radius which is why
      we have `rx` and `ry`. -->
    <ellipse cx="250" cy="125" rx="100" ry="25" />

    <!-- A line.  A stroke color must be defined for the line to be visible. -->
    <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="500" y2="150" stroke="black" />

    <!-- A polyline.  Each set of points are connected through straight line
      segments.  The start and end points do not connect. -->
    <polyline points="0,40 40,40 40,80 80,80 80,120 120,120 120,160" fill="red" stroke="#BBC42A" stroke-width="6" />

    <!-- A polygon.  Each set of points are connected through straight line
      segments.  The start and end points are connected. -->
    <polygon points="50,5 100,5 125,30 125,80 100,105 50,105 25,80 25,30" fill="#ED6E46" />

    <!-- A path.  The `d` (data) attribute contains the path commands:
      - moveto (`M` or `m`) establishes a new point.  Path data must begin with
        this command.
      - closepath (`Z` or `z`) ends the current subpath and draws a straight
        line from that point to the initial point of the path.
      - The lineto commands draws a straight line from the current point to a
        new point which then becomes the current point.
        - `L` and `l` draws a line from the current point to the new point.
        - `H` and `h` draws a horizontal line from the current point.
        - `V` and `v` draws a vertical line from the current point.
        - `L`, `H`, and `V` signify absolute coordinates while `l`, `h`,
          and`v` signify relative coordinates.
      - The Cubic Bézier commands draw a curve from the current point.
        - `C` and `c` draws the curve using a couple control points to define
          the shape details of the curve.
        - `S` and `s` draws the curve assuming that the first control point is
          a reflection of the second control point.  This reflection is relative
          to the start point.
        - `C` and `S` signify absolute coordinates while `c` and `s` signify
          relative coordinates.
      - The Quadratic Bézier commands draw a curve from the current point.
        - `Q` and `q` draws the curve using a single control point.
        - `T` and `t` draws the curve from the initial point to the end point
          by assuming that the control point is a reflection of the control on
          the previous command relative to the start point of the new `T` or
          `t` command.
        - `Q` and `T` signify absolute coordinates while `q` and `t` signify
          relative coordinates.
