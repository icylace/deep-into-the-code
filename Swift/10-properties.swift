// TODO

// - are there stored type properties?

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Property - A constant or variable associated with a particular type.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Stored property - A property that is stored within an instance of a
//                    class or structure.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can provide a default value for a stored property as part of its definition,
as described in Default Property Values. You can also set and modify the initial
value for a stored property during initialization. This is true even for constant
stored properties, as described in Assigning Constant Properties During Initialization.

The example below defines a structure called FixedLengthRange, which describes a
range of integers whose range length cannot be changed once it is created:

struct FixedLengthRange {
  var firstValue: Int
  let length: Int
}

var rangeOfThreeItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 3)
// the range represents integer values 0, 1, and 2
rangeOfThreeItems.firstValue = 6
// the range now represents integer values 6, 7, and 8

Instances of FixedLengthRange have a variable stored property called firstValue
and a constant stored property called length. In the example above, length is
initialized when the new range is created and cannot be changed thereafter,
because it is a constant property.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stored Properties of Constant Structure Instances

If you create an instance of a structure and assign that instance to a constant,
you cannot modify the instance’s properties, even if they were declared as
variable properties:

let rangeOfFourItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 4)
// this range represents integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3
rangeOfFourItems.firstValue = 6
// this will report an error, even though firstValue is a variable property

Because rangeOfFourItems is declared as a constant (with the let keyword), it is
not possible to change its firstValue property, even though firstValue is a variable property.

This behavior is due to structures being value types. When an instance of a value
type is marked as a constant, so are all of its properties.

The same is not true for classes, which are reference types. If you assign an
instance of a reference type to a constant, you can still change that instance’s
variable properties.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Lazy stored property - A stored property whose initial value is not
//                         calculated until the first it's used.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// You must always declare a lazy property as a variable because
// its initial value might not be retrieved until after instance
// initialization completes.  Constant properties must always
// have a value before initialization completes, and
// therefore cannot be declared as lazy.

// Lazy properties are useful when the initial value for a property is dependent
// on outside factors whose values are not known until after an instance's
// initialization is complete.  Lazy properties are also useful when the
// initial value for a property requires complex or computationally
// expensive setup that should not be performed unless or until
// it is needed.

class DataImporter {
  /*
   DataImporter is a class to import data from an external file.
   The class is assumed to take a non-trivial amount of time to initialize.
   */
  var fileName = "data.txt"
  // the DataImporter class would provide data importing functionality here
}

class DataManager {
  lazy var importer = DataImporter()
  var data = [String]()
  // the DataManager class would provide data management functionality here
}

let manager = DataManager()
manager.data.append("Some data")
manager.data.append("Some more data")
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property has not yet been created

The DataManager class has a stored property called data, which is initialized
with a new, empty array of String values. Although the rest of its functionality
is not shown, the purpose of this DataManager class is to manage and provide
access to this array of String data.

Part of the functionality of the DataManager class is the ability to import data
from a file. This functionality is provided by the DataImporter class, which is
assumed to take a non-trivial amount of time to initialize. This might be because
a DataImporter instance needs to open a file and read its contents into memory
when the DataImporter instance is initialized.

It is possible for a DataManager instance to manage its data without ever importing
data from a file, so there is no need to create a new DataImporter instance when
the DataManager itself is created. Instead, it makes more sense to create the
DataImporter instance if and when it is first used.

Because it is marked with the lazy modifier, the DataImporter instance for the
importer property is only created when the importer property is first accessed,
such as when its fileName property is queried:

print(manager.importer.fileName)
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property has now been created
// Prints "data.txt"

NOTE

If a property marked with the lazy modifier is accessed by multiple threads
simultaneously and the property has not yet been initialized, there is no
guarantee that the property will be initialized only once.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stored Properties and Instance Variables

If you have experience with Objective-C, you may know that it provides two ways
to store values and references as part of a class instance. In addition to
properties, you can use instance variables as a backing store for the values
stored in a property.

Swift unifies these concepts into a single property declaration. A Swift property
does not have a corresponding instance variable, and the backing store for a
property is not accessed directly. This approach avoids confusion about how the
value is accessed in different contexts and simplifies the property’s declaration
into a single, definitive statement. All information about the property—including
its name, type, and memory management characteristics—is defined in a single
location as part of the type’s definition.


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Computed property - A property whose value is calculated when used.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



// The type of `newValue` is the same as the return value of the computed
// property.  You can choose not to specify the setter's `newValue`
// parameter.  A default parameter called `newValue` is provided
// to your setter if you do not provide one yourself.





Computed Properties

In addition to stored properties, classes, structures, and enumerations can define computed properties, which do not actually store a value. Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.

struct Point {
  var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}

struct Size {
  var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}

struct Rect {
  var origin = Point()
  var size = Size()
  var center: Point {
    get {
      let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
      let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
      return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
    }
    set(newCenter) {
      origin.x = newCenter.x - (size.width / 2)
      origin.y = newCenter.y - (size.height / 2)
    }
  }
}

var square = Rect(origin: Point(x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
                  size: Size(width: 10.0, height: 10.0))
let initialSquareCenter = square.center
square.center = Point(x: 15.0, y: 15.0)
print("square.origin is now at (\(square.origin.x), \(square.origin.y))")
// Prints "square.origin is now at (10.0, 10.0)"

This example defines three structures for working with geometric shapes:

Point encapsulates an (x, y) coordinate.
Size encapsulates a width and a height.
Rect defines a rectangle by an origin point and a size.
The Rect structure also provides a computed property called center. The current center position of a Rect can always be determined from its origin and size, and so you don’t need to store the center point as an explicit Point value. Instead, Rect defines a custom getter and setter for a computed variable called center, to enable you to work with the rectangle’s center as if it were a real stored property.

The preceding example creates a new Rect variable called square. The square variable is initialized with an origin point of (0, 0), and a width and height of 10. This square is represented by the blue square in the diagram below.

The square variable’s center property is then accessed through dot syntax (square.center), which causes the getter for center to be called, to retrieve the current property value. Rather than returning an existing value, the getter actually calculates and returns a new Point to represent the center of the square. As can be seen above, the getter correctly returns a center point of (5, 5).

The center property is then set to a new value of (15, 15), which moves the square up and to the right, to the new position shown by the orange square in the diagram below. Setting the center property calls the setter for center, which modifies the x and y values of the stored origin property, and moves the square to its new position.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shorthand Setter Declaration

If a computed property’s setter does not define a name for the new value to be set, a default name of newValue is used. Here’s an alternative version of the Rect structure, which takes advantage of this shorthand notation:

struct AlternativeRect {
  var origin = Point()
  var size = Size()
  var center: Point {
    get {
      let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
      let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
      return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
    }
    set {
      origin.x = newValue.x - (size.width / 2)
      origin.y = newValue.y - (size.height / 2)
    }
  }
}

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read-Only Computed Properties

A computed property with a getter but no setter is known as a read-only computed property. A read-only computed property always returns a value, and can be accessed through dot syntax, but cannot be set to a different value.

NOTE

You must declare computed properties—including read-only computed properties—as variable properties with the var keyword, because their value is not fixed. The let keyword is only used for constant properties, to indicate that their values cannot be changed once they are set as part of instance initialization.

You can simplify the declaration of a read-only computed property by removing the get keyword and its braces:

struct Cuboid {
  var width = 0.0, height = 0.0, depth = 0.0
  var volume: Double {
    return width * height * depth
  }
}

let fourByFiveByTwo = Cuboid(width: 4.0, height: 5.0, depth: 2.0)
print("the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is \(fourByFiveByTwo.volume)")
// Prints "the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is 40.0"

This example defines a new structure called Cuboid, which represents a 3D rectangular box with width, height, and depth properties. This structure also has a read-only computed property called volume, which calculates and returns the current volume of the cuboid. It doesn’t make sense for volume to be settable, because it would be ambiguous as to which values of width, height, and depth should be used for a particular volume value. Nonetheless, it is useful for a Cuboid to provide a read-only computed property to enable external users to discover its current calculated volume.














// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Property observer - A code block that monitors, and can react to,
//                      changes in a particular property's value.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Property observers can be added to stored properties you define
// yourself, and also to properties that a subclass inherits from
// its superclass.


Property Observers

Property observers observe and respond to changes in a property’s value. Property observers are called every time a property’s value is set, even if the new value is the same as the property’s current value.

You can add property observers to any stored properties you define, except for lazy stored properties. You can also add property observers to any inherited property (whether stored or computed) by overriding the property within a subclass. You don’t need to define property observers for nonoverridden computed properties, because you can observe and respond to changes to their value in the computed property’s setter. Property overriding is described in Overriding.

You have the option to define either or both of these observers on a property:

willSet is called just before the value is stored.
didSet is called immediately after the new value is stored.

If you implement a willSet observer, it’s passed the new property value as a constant parameter. You can specify a name for this parameter as part of your willSet implementation. If you don’t write the parameter name and parentheses within your implementation, the parameter is made available with a default parameter name of newValue.

Similarly, if you implement a didSet observer, it’s passed a constant parameter containing the old property value. You can name the parameter or use the default parameter name of oldValue. If you assign a value to a property within its own didSet observer, the new value that you assign replaces the one that was just set.

NOTE

The willSet and didSet observers of superclass properties are called when a property is set in a subclass initializer, after the superclass initializer has been called. They are not called while a class is setting its own properties, before the superclass initializer has been called.

For more information about initializer delegation, see Initializer Delegation for Value Types and Initializer Delegation for Class Types.

Here’s an example of willSet and didSet in action. The example below defines a new class called StepCounter, which tracks the total number of steps that a person takes while walking. This class might be used with input data from a pedometer or other step counter to keep track of a person’s exercise during their daily routine.

class StepCounter {
  var totalSteps: Int = 0 {
    willSet(newTotalSteps) {
      print("About to set totalSteps to \(newTotalSteps)")
    }
    didSet {
      if totalSteps > oldValue  {
        print("Added \(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
      }
    }
  }
}

let stepCounter = StepCounter()
stepCounter.totalSteps = 200
// About to set totalSteps to 200
// Added 200 steps
stepCounter.totalSteps = 360
// About to set totalSteps to 360
// Added 160 steps
stepCounter.totalSteps = 896
// About to set totalSteps to 896
// Added 536 steps

The StepCounter class declares a totalSteps property of type Int. This is a stored property with willSet and didSet observers.

The willSet and didSet observers for totalSteps are called whenever the property is assigned a new value. This is true even if the new value is the same as the current value.

This example’s willSet observer uses a custom parameter name of newTotalSteps for the upcoming new value. In this example, it simply prints out the value that is about to be set.

The didSet observer is called after the value of totalSteps is updated. It compares the new value of totalSteps against the old value. If the total number of steps has increased, a message is printed to indicate how many new steps have been taken. The didSet observer does not provide a custom parameter name for the old value, and the default name of oldValue is used instead.

NOTE

If you pass a property that has observers to a function as an in-out parameter, the willSet and didSet observers are always called. This is because of the copy-in copy-out memory model for in-out parameters: The value is always written back to the property at the end of the function. For a detailed discussion of the behavior of in-out parameters, see In-Out Parameters.


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Global and Local Variables
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The capabilities described above for computing and observing properties are also available to global variables and local variables. Global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function, method, closure, or type context. Local variables are variables that are defined within a function, method, or closure context.

The global and local variables you have encountered in previous chapters have all been stored variables. Stored variables, like stored properties, provide storage for a value of a certain type and allow that value to be set and retrieved.

However, you can also define computed variables and define observers for stored variables, in either a global or local scope. Computed variables calculate their value, rather than storing it, and they are written in the same way as computed properties.

NOTE

Global constants and variables are always computed lazily, in a similar manner to Lazy Stored Properties. Unlike lazy stored properties, global constants and variables do not need to be marked with the lazy modifier.

Local constants and variables are never computed lazily.


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Type property - A property associated with the type itself.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instance properties are properties that belong to an instance of a particular type.
Every time you create a new instance of that type, it has its own set of property
values, separate from any other instance.

You can also define properties that belong to the type itself, not to any one
instance of that type. There will only ever be one copy of these properties,
no matter how many instances of that type you create. These kinds of properties
are called type properties.

Type properties are useful for defining values that are universal to all instances
of a particular type, such as a constant property that all instances can use (like
a static constant in C), or a variable property that stores a value that is global
to all instances of that type (like a static variable in C).

Stored type properties can be variables or constants. Computed type properties are
always declared as variable properties, in the same way as computed instance properties.

NOTE

Unlike stored instance properties, you must always give stored type properties a
default value. This is because the type itself does not have an initializer that
can assign a value to a stored type property at initialization time.

Stored type properties are lazily initialized on their first access. They are
guaranteed to be initialized only once, even when accessed by multiple threads
simultaneously, and they do not need to be marked with the lazy modifier.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type Property Syntax

In C and Objective-C, you define static constants and variables associated with
a type as global static variables. In Swift, however, type properties are written
as part of the type’s definition, within the type’s outer curly braces, and each
type property is explicitly scoped to the type it supports.

You define type properties with the static keyword. For computed type properties
for class types, you can use the class keyword instead to allow subclasses to
override the superclass’s implementation. The example below shows the syntax
for stored and computed type properties:

struct SomeStructure {
  static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
  static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
    return 1
  }
}

enum SomeEnumeration {
  static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
  static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
    return 6
  }
}

class SomeClass {
  static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
  static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
    return 27
  }
  class var overrideableComputedTypeProperty: Int {
    return 107
  }
}

NOTE

The computed type property examples above are for read-only computed type
properties, but you can also define read-write computed type properties
with the same syntax as for computed instance properties.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Querying and Setting Type Properties

Type properties are queried and set with dot syntax, just like instance properties.
However, type properties are queried and set on the type, not on an instance of that
type. For example:

print(SomeStructure.storedTypeProperty)
// Prints "Some value."
SomeStructure.storedTypeProperty = "Another value."
print(SomeStructure.storedTypeProperty)
// Prints "Another value."
print(SomeEnumeration.computedTypeProperty)
// Prints "6"
print(SomeClass.computedTypeProperty)
// Prints "27"

The examples that follow use two stored type properties as part of a structure that
models an audio level meter for a number of audio channels. Each channel has an
integer audio level between 0 and 10 inclusive.

The figure below illustrates how two of these audio channels can be combined to
model a stereo audio level meter. When a channel’s audio level is 0, none of the
lights for that channel are lit. When the audio level is 10, all of the lights
for that channel are lit. In this figure, the left channel has a current level
of 9, and the right channel has a current level of 7:

image: ../Art/staticPropertiesVUMeter_2x.png

The audio channels described above are represented by instances of the AudioChannel structure:

struct AudioChannel {
  static let thresholdLevel = 10
  static var maxInputLevelForAllChannels = 0
  var currentLevel: Int = 0 {
    didSet {
      if currentLevel > AudioChannel.thresholdLevel {
        // cap the new audio level to the threshold level
        currentLevel = AudioChannel.thresholdLevel
      }
      if currentLevel > AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels {
        // store this as the new overall maximum input level
        AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels = currentLevel
      }
    }
  }
}

The AudioChannel structure defines two stored type properties to support its
functionality. The first, thresholdLevel, defines the maximum threshold value
an audio level can take. This is a constant value of 10 for all AudioChannel
instances. If an audio signal comes in with a higher value than 10, it will
be capped to this threshold value (as described below).

The second type property is a variable stored property called maxInputLevelForAllChannels.
This keeps track of the maximum input value that has been received by any AudioChannel
instance. It starts with an initial value of 0.

The AudioChannel structure also defines a stored instance property called
currentLevel, which represents the channel’s current audio level on a scale
of 0 to 10.

The currentLevel property has a didSet property observer to check the value of
currentLevel whenever it is set. This observer performs two checks:

- If the new value of currentLevel is greater than the allowed thresholdLevel,
the property observer caps currentLevel to thresholdLevel.
- If the new value of currentLevel (after any capping) is higher than any value
previously received by any AudioChannel instance, the property observer stores
the new currentLevel value in the maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property.

NOTE

In the first of these two checks, the didSet observer sets currentLevel to a
different value. This does not, however, cause the observer to be called again.

You can use the AudioChannel structure to create two new audio channels called
leftChannel and rightChannel, to represent the audio levels of a stereo sound system:

var leftChannel = AudioChannel()
var rightChannel = AudioChannel()

If you set the currentLevel of the left channel to 7, you can see that the
maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property is updated to equal 7:

leftChannel.currentLevel = 7
print(leftChannel.currentLevel)
// Prints "7"
print(AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels)
// Prints "7"

If you try to set the currentLevel of the right channel to 11, you can see that
the right channel’s currentLevel property is capped to the maximum value of 10,
and the maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property is updated to equal 10:

rightChannel.currentLevel = 11
print(rightChannel.currentLevel)
// Prints "10"
print(AudioChannel.maxInputLevelForAllChannels)
// Prints "10"
