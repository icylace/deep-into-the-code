// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  `switch` statement - The conditional statement that has at least one branch.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// A `switch` statement considers a value and compares it against several
// possible matching patterns.  It then executes an appropriate block
// of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully.
// A `switch` statement is an alternative to multiple `if`
// statements for responding to multiple potential states.

// In its simplest form, a `switch` statement compares a value against one
// or more values of the same type.

switch some value to consider {
case value 1:
  respond to value 1
case value 2, value 3:
  respond to value 2 or 3
default:
  otherwise, do something else
}

Every `switch` statement consists of multiple possible cases, each of which begins
with the case keyword.  In addition to comparing against specific values, Swift
provides several ways for each case to specify more complex matching patterns.
These options are described later in this chapter.

Each case is a separate branch of code execution.  The `switch` statement
determines which branch should be selected.  This procedure is known
as switching on the value that is being considered.

Every `switch` statement must be exhaustive.  That is, every possible value of the
type being considered must be matched by one of the `switch` cases.  If it's not
appropriate to provide a case for every possible value, you can define a default
case to cover any values that are not addressed explicitly.  This default case
is indicated by the default keyword, and must always appear last.

let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
  print("The first letter of the alphabet")
case "z":
  print("The last letter of the alphabet")
default:
  print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the alphabet"

// The `switch` statement's first case matches the first letter of the English
// alphabet, a, and its second case matches the last letter, z.  Because the
// `switch` must have a case for every possible character, not just every
// alphabetic character, this `switch` statement uses a default case to
// match all characters other than a and z.  This provision ensures
// that the `switch` statement is exhaustive.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  No Implicit Fallthrough
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// `switch` statements in Swift do not fall through the bottom of each case and
// into the next one by default.  Instead, the entire `switch` statement
// finishes its execution as soon as the first matching `switch` case is
// completed, without requiring an explicit `break` statement.

NOTE

Although `break` is not required in Swift, you can use a `break` statement to
match and ignore a particular case or to break out of a matched case before
that case has completed its execution.

The body of each case must contain at least one executable statement. It is not
valid to write the following code, because the first case is empty:

let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter {
case "a": // Invalid, the case has an empty body
case "A":
  print("The letter A")
default:
  print("Not the letter A")
}
// This will report a compile-time error.

// Unlike a `switch` statement in C, this `switch` statement does not match both
// "a" and "A".  Rather, it reports a compile-time error that case "a": does
// not contain any executable statements. This approach avoids accidental
// fallthrough from one case to another and makes for safer code that
// is clearer in its intent.

// To make a switch with a single case that matches both "a" and "A", combine
// the two values into a compound case, separating the values with commas.

let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter {
case "a", "A":
  print("The letter A")
default:
  print("Not the letter A")
}
// Prints "The letter A"

For readability, a compound case can also be written over multiple lines.
For more information about compound cases, see Compound Cases.

NOTE

To explicitly fall through at the end of a particular switch case, use the
fallthrough keyword, as described in Fallthrough.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interval Matching

Values in switch cases can be checked for their inclusion in an interval.
This example uses number intervals to provide a natural-language count
for numbers of any size:

let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
var naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
  naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
  naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
  naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
  naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
  naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
  naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuples

You can use tuples to test multiple values in the same switch statement.
Each element of the tuple can be tested against a different value or
interval of values. Alternatively, use the underscore character (_),
also known as the wildcard pattern, to match any possible value.

let somePoint = (1, 1)
switch somePoint {
case (0, 0):
  print("(0, 0) is at the origin")
case (_, 0):
  print("(\(somePoint.0), 0) is on the x-axis")
case (0, _):
  print("(0, \(somePoint.1)) is on the y-axis")
case (-2...2, -2...2):
  print("(\(somePoint.0), \(somePoint.1)) is inside the box")
default:
  print("(\(somePoint.0), \(somePoint.1)) is outside of the box")
}
// Prints "(1, 1) is inside the box"

image: ../Art/coordinateGraphSimple_2x.png

The `switch` statement determines whether the point is at the origin (0, 0),
on the red x-axis, on the orange y-axis, inside the blue 4-by-4 box centered
on the origin, or outside of the box.

Unlike C, Swift allows multiple switch cases to consider the same value or values.
In fact, the point (0, 0) could match all four of the cases in this example.
However, if multiple matches are possible, the first matching case is always
used. The point (0, 0) would match case (0, 0) first, and so all other matching
cases would be ignored.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Value Bindings

A switch case can bind the value or values it matches to temporary constants or
variables, for use in the body of the case. This behavior is known as value binding,
because the values are bound to temporary constants or variables within the caseâ€™s body.

let anotherPoint = (2, 0)
switch anotherPoint {
case (let x, 0):
  print("on the x-axis with an x value of \(x)")
case (0, let y):
  print("on the y-axis with a y value of \(y)")
case let (x, y):
  print("somewhere else at (\(x), \(y))")
}
// Prints "on the x-axis with an x value of 2"

image: ../Art/coordinateGraphMedium_2x.png

The switch statement determines whether the point is on the red x-axis, on the
orange y-axis, or elsewhere (on neither axis).

The three switch cases declare placeholder constants x and y, which temporarily
take on one or both tuple values from anotherPoint. The first case, case (let x, 0),
matches any point with a y value of 0 and assigns the pointâ€™s x value to the temporary
constant x. Similarly, the second case, case (0, let y), matches any point with an x
value of 0 and assigns the pointâ€™s y value to the temporary constant y.

After the temporary constants are declared, they can be used within the caseâ€™s code
block. Here, they are used to print the categorization of the point.

This switch statement does not have a default case. The final case, case let (x, y),
declares a tuple of two placeholder constants that can match any value. Because
anotherPoint is always a tuple of two values, this case matches all possible
remaining values, and a default case is not needed to make the switch statement
exhaustive.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where

A switch case can use a where clause to check for additional conditions.

let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
  print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
  print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
  print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"

image: ../Art/coordinateGraphComplex_2x.png

The switch statement determines whether the point is on the green diagonal line
where x == y, on the purple diagonal line where x == -y, or neither.

The three switch cases declare placeholder constants x and y, which temporarily
take on the two tuple values from yetAnotherPoint. These constants are used as
part of a where clause, to create a dynamic filter. The switch case matches the
current value of point only if the where clauseâ€™s condition evaluates to true
for that value.

As in the previous example, the final case matches all possible remaining values,
and so a default case is not needed to make the switch statement exhaustive.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compound Cases

// Multiple switch cases that share the same body can be combined by writing
// several patterns after case, with a comma between each of the patterns.
// If any of the patterns match, then the case is considered to match.
// The patterns can be written over multiple lines if the list is
// long.  For example:

let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
  print("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
  print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
  print("\(someCharacter) is not a vowel or a consonant")
}
// Prints "e is a vowel"

Compound cases can also include value bindings.  All of the patterns of a
compound case have to include the same set of value bindings, and each
binding has to get a value of the same type from all of the patterns
in the compound case.  This ensures that, no matter which part of
the compound case matched, the code in the body of the case can
always access a value for the bindings and that the value
always has the same type.

let stillAnotherPoint = (9, 0)
switch stillAnotherPoint {
case (let distance, 0), (0, let distance):
  print("On an axis, \(distance) from the origin")
default:
  print("Not on an axis")
}
// Prints "On an axis, 9 from the origin"

The case above has two patterns: (let distance, 0) matches points on the x-axis
and (0, let distance) matches points on the y-axis. Both patterns include a
binding for distance and distance is an integer in both patternsâ€”which means
that the code in the body of the case can always access a value for distance.















let tuple = (1.0, "hello")
print(tuple.0)
print(tuple.1)

// if case {
// }

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// `switch`

var s = 0
switch s {
case 0:
  print(0)
default:
  print("non-zero")
}

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
var naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
  naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
  naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
  naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
  naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
  naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
  naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."






















































// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Control Transfer Statements
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Control transfer statements change the order in which your code is executed,
// by transferring control from one piece of code to another.  Swift has five
// control transfer statements:

continue
break
fallthrough
return
throw

The continue, break, and fallthrough statements are described below.  The return
statement is described in Functions, and the throw statement is described in
Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue

The continue statement tells a loop to stop what it is doing and start again at
the beginning of the next iteration through the loop.  It says "I am done with
the current loop iteration" without leaving the loop altogether.

let puzzleInput = "great minds think alike"
var puzzleOutput = ""
for character in puzzleInput.characters {
  switch character {
  case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u", " ":
    continue
  default:
    puzzleOutput.append(character)
  }
}

print(puzzleOutput)
// Prints "grtmndsthnklk"

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  `break` statement - The statement that ends execution of an entire
//                      control flow statement immediately.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The `break` statement can be used inside a switch statement or loop statement
// when you want to terminate the execution of the switch or loop statement
// earlier than would otherwise be the case.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Break in a Loop Statement

When used inside a loop statement, break ends the loopâ€™s execution immediately
and transfers control to the first line of code after the loopâ€™s closing brace
(`}`). No further code from the current iteration of the loop is executed, and
no further iterations of the loop are started.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Break in a Switch Statement

When used inside a switch statement, break causes the switch statement to end
its execution immediately and to transfer control to the first line of code
after the switch statementâ€™s closing brace (}).

This behavior can be used to match and ignore one or more cases in a switch
statement. Because Swiftâ€™s switch statement is exhaustive and does not allow
empty cases, it is sometimes necessary to deliberately match and ignore a case
in order to make your intentions explicit. You do this by writing the break
statement as the entire body of the case you want to ignore. When that case
is matched by the switch statement, the break statement inside the case ends
the switch statementâ€™s execution immediately.

NOTE

A switch case that contains only a comment is reported as a compile-time error.
Comments are not statements and do not cause a switch case to be ignored. Always
use a break statement to ignore a switch case.

The following example switches on a Character value and determines whether it
represents a number symbol in one of four languages. For brevity, multiple
values are covered in a single switch case.

let numberSymbol: Character = "ä¸‰"  // Chinese symbol for the number 3
var possibleIntegerValue: Int?

switch numberSymbol {
case "1", "Ù¡", "ä¸€", "à¹‘":
  possibleIntegerValue = 1
case "2", "Ù¢", "äºŒ", "à¹’":
  possibleIntegerValue = 2
case "3", "Ù£", "ä¸‰", "à¹“":
  possibleIntegerValue = 3
case "4", "Ù¤", "å››", "à¹”":
  possibleIntegerValue = 4
default:
  break
}

if let integerValue = possibleIntegerValue {
  print("The integer value of \(numberSymbol) is \(integerValue).")
} else {
  print("An integer value could not be found for \(numberSymbol).")
}
// Prints "The integer value of ä¸‰ is 3."

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fallthrough

`switch` statements in Swift donâ€™t fall through the bottom of each case and into
the next one.  Instead, the entire `switch` statement completes its execution as
soon as the first matching case is completed.  This avoids executing multiple
`switch` cases by mistake.

You can opt in to fallthrough behavior on a case-by-case basis with the
`fallthrough` keyword.

let integerToDescribe = 5
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"

switch integerToDescribe {
case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
  description += " a prime number, and also"
  fallthrough
default:
  description += " an integer."
}

print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."

After the switch statement has finished executing, the numberâ€™s description is
printed using the print(_:separator:terminator:) function.  In this example,
the number 5 is correctly identified as a prime number.

NOTE

The fallthrough keyword does not check the case conditions for the switch case
that it causes execution to fall into.  The fallthrough keyword simply causes
code execution to move directly to the statements inside the next case (or
default case) block, as in Câ€™s standard switch statement behavior.







// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Labeled Statements

Loop statements and conditional statements can be nestd inside other loops and
conditionals.  However, both use the `break` statement to end their execution
prematurely.  Therefore, it is sometimes useful to be explicit about which
loop or conditional you want a `break` statement to terminate.  Similarly,
if you have multiple nested loops, it can be useful to be explicit about
which loop the continue statement should affect.

To achieve these aims, you can mark a loop statement or conditional statement
with a statement label.  With a conditional statement, you can use a statement
label with the break statement to end the execution of the labeled statement.
With a loop statement, you can use a statement label with the break or continue
statement to end or continue the execution of the labeled statement.

A labeled statement is indicated by placing a label on the same line as the
statementâ€™s introducer keyword, followed by a colon.  Here's an example of
this syntax for a while loop, although the principle is the same for all
loops and switch statements:

label name: while condition {
  statements
}

The following example uses the break and continue statements with a labeled
while loop for an adapted version of the Snakes and Ladders game that you
saw earlier in this chapter.  This time around, the game has an extra rule:

- To win, you must land exactly on square 25.

If a particular dice roll would take you beyond square 25, you must roll again
until you roll the exact number needed to land on square 25.

The game board is the same as before.

image: ../Art/snakesAndLadders_2x.png

The values of finalSquare, board, square, and diceRoll are initialized in the
same way as before:

let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0

This version of the game uses a while loop and a switch statement to implement
the gameâ€™s logic.  The while loop has a statement label called gameLoop to
indicate that it is the main game loop for the Snakes and Ladders game.

The while loopâ€™s condition is while square != finalSquare, to reflect that you
must land exactly on square 25.

gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
  diceRoll += 1
  if diceRoll == 7 {
    diceRoll = 1
  }
  switch square + diceRoll {
  case finalSquare:
    // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
    break gameLoop
  case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
    // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
    continue gameLoop
  default:
    // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
    square += diceRoll
    square += board[square]
  }
}
print("Game over!")

The dice is rolled at the start of each loop. Rather than moving the player
immediately, the loop uses a switch statement to consider the result of the
move and to determine whether the move is allowed:

- If the dice roll will move the player onto the final square, the game is over.
  The break gameLoop statement transfers control to the first line of code
  outside of the while loop, which ends the game.

- If the dice roll will move the player beyond the final square, the move is
  invalid and the player needs to roll again. The continue gameLoop statement
  ends the current while loop iteration and begins the next iteration of the loop.

- In all other cases, the dice roll is a valid move.  The player moves forward
  by diceRoll squares, and the game logic checks for any snakes and ladders.
  The loop then ends, and control returns to the while condition to decide
  whether another turn is required.

If the break statement above did not use the gameLoop label, it would break out
of the switch statement, not the while statement. Using the gameLoop label makes
it clear which control statement should be terminated.

It is not strictly necessary to use the gameLoop label when calling continue
gameLoop to jump to the next iteration of the loop. There is only one loop in
the game, and therefore no ambiguity as to which loop the continue statement
will affect. However, there is no harm in using the gameLoop label with the
continue statement. Doing so is consistent with the labelâ€™s use alongside the
break statement and helps make the gameâ€™s logic clearer to read and understand.









// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Early Exit
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A guard statement, like an if statement, executes statements depending on the
Boolean value of an expression.  You use a guard statement to require that a
condition must be true in order for the code after the guard statement to be
executed.  Unlike an if statement, a guard statement always has an else
clause-the code inside the else clause is executed if the condition is not true.

func greet(person: [String: String]) {
  guard let name = person["name"] else {
    return
  }

  print("Hello \(name)!")

  guard let location = person["location"] else {
    print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
    return
  }

  print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}

greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."

If the guard statement's condition is met, code execution continues after the
guard statementâ€™s closing brace.  Any variables or constants that were assigned
values using an optional binding as part of the condition are available for the
rest of the code block that the guard statement appears in.

If that condition is not met, the code inside the else branch is executed.
That branch must transfer control to exit the code block in which the guard
statement appears.  It can do this with a control transfer statement such
as return, break, continue, or throw, or it can call a function or method
that doesn't return, such as fatalError(_:file:line:).

Using a guard statement for requirements improves the readability of your code,
compared to doing the same check with an if statement.  It lets you write the
code that's typically executed without wrapping it in an else block, and it
lets you keep the code that handles a violated requirement next to the requirement.

//  Checking API Availability
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Swift has built-in support for checking API availability, which lets you
// ensure that you don't accidentally use APIs that are unavailable on a
// given deployment target.

// The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of
// the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified
// by your project.  A compile-time error is flagged if you try to use an API
// that isnâ€™t available.

// You use an availability condition in an `if` or `guard` statement to
// conditionally execute a block of code, depending on whether the APIs
// you want to use are available at runtime.  The compiler uses the
// information from the availability condition when it verifies
// that the APIs in that block of code are available.

if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
  // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
  // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}

// TODO
// - is `#available` able to be used in `switch` ?

// The availability condition above specifies that on iOS, the body of the
// if executes only on iOS 10 and later; on macOS, only on macOS 10.12 and
// later.  The last argument, *, is required and specifies that on
// and other platform, the body of the if executes on the minimum
// deployment target specified by your target.

In its general form, the availability condition takes a list of platform names
and versions. You use platform names such as iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOSâ€”for
the full list, see Declaration Attributes.  In addition to specifying major
version numbers like iOS 8, you can specify minor versions numbers like
iOS 8.3 and macOS 10.10.3.

if #available(platform name version, ..., *) {
  statements to execute if the APIs are available
} else {
  fallback statements to execute if the APIs are unavailable
}
