// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Set - A collection type having unordered distinct values of similar type.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined
// ordering.  You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items is
// not important, or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.

// Swift‚Äôs Set type is bridged to Foundation's NSSet class.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Hash Values for Set Types
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set‚Äîthat is, the type must
// provide a way to compute a hash value for itself. A hash value is an Int
// value that is the same for all objects that compare equally, such that
// if a == b, it follows that a.hashValue == b.hashValue.

// All of Swift‚Äôs basic types (such as String, Int, Double, and Bool) are
// hashable by default, and can be used as set value types or dictionary
// key types.

// Enumeration case values without associated values are also hashable
// by default.

/*

NOTE

You can use your own custom types as set value types or dictionary key types by
making them conform to the Hashable protocol from Swift‚Äôs standard library.
Types that conform to the Hashable protocol must provide a gettable Int property
called hashValue. The value returned by a type‚Äôs hashValue property is not
required to be the same across different executions of the same program,
or in different programs.

Because the Hashable protocol conforms to Equatable, conforming types must also
provide an implementation of the equals operator (==). The Equatable protocol
requires any conforming implementation of == to be an equivalence relation.
That is, an implementation of == must satisfy the following three conditions,
for all values a, b, and c:

a == a (Reflexivity)

a == b implies b == a (Symmetry)

a == b && b == c implies a == c (Transitivity)

For more information about conforming to protocols, see Protocols.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set Type Syntax

The type of a Swift set is written as Set<Element>, where Element is the type
that the set is allowed to store.  Unlike arrays and dictionaries, sets do
not have an equivalent shorthand form.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating and Initializing an Empty Set

You can create an empty set of a certain type using initializer syntax:

var letters = Set<Character>()
assert(type(of: letters) == Set<Character>.self)
assert(letters.count == 0)

Alternatively, if the context already provides type information, such as a function
argument or an already typed variable or constant, you can create an empty set with
an empty array literal:

letters.insert("a")
// letters now contains 1 value of type Character
letters = []
// letters is now an empty set, but is still of type Set<Character>

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a Set with an Array Literal

You can also initialize a set with an array literal, as a shorthand way to write
one or more values as a set collection.

The example below creates a set called favoriteGenres to store String values:

var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items

The favoriteGenres variable is declared as ‚Äúa set of String values‚Äù,
written as Set<String>. Because this particular set has specified a
value type of String, it is only allowed to store String values.
Here, the favoriteGenres set is initialized with three String
values ("Rock", "Classical", and "Hip hop"), written within
an array literal.

NOTE

The favoriteGenres set is declared as a variable (with the var introducer) and
not a constant (with the let introducer) because items are added and removed
in the examples below.

A set type cannot be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must
be explicitly declared. However, because of Swift‚Äôs type inference, you don‚Äôt
have to write the type of the set if you‚Äôre initializing it with an array
literal containing values of the same type. The initialization of
favoriteGenres could have been written in a shorter form instead:

var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]

Because all values in the array literal are of the same type, Swift can infer
that Set<String> is the correct type to use for the favoriteGenres variable.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accessing and Modifying a Set

You access and modify a set through its methods and properties.

To find out the number of items in a set, check its read-only count property:

print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."

Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:

if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
  print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
} else {
  print("I have particular music preferences.")
}
// Prints "I have particular music preferences."

You can add a new item into a set by calling the set‚Äôs insert(_:) method:

favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")
// favoriteGenres now contains 4 items

You can remove an item from a set by calling the set‚Äôs remove(_:) method, which
removes the item if it‚Äôs a member of the set, and returns the removed value,
or returns nil if the set did not contain it. Alternatively, all items in a
set can be removed with its removeAll() method.

if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
  print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
} else {
  print("I never much cared for that.")
}
// Prints "Rock? I'm over it."

To check whether a set contains a particular item, use the contains(_:) method.

if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
  print("I get up on the good foot.")
} else {
  print("It's too funky in here.")
}
// Prints "It's too funky in here."

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterating Over a Set

You can iterate over the values in a set with a for-in loop.

for genre in favoriteGenres {
  print("\(genre)")
}
// Jazz
// Hip hop
// Classical

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more about the for-in loop, see For-In Loops.

Swift‚Äôs Set type does not have a defined ordering. To iterate over the values
of a set in a specific order, use the sorted() method, which returns the set‚Äôs
elements as an array sorted using the < operator.

for genre in favoriteGenres.sorted() {
  print("\(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Hip hop
// Jazz

Performing Set Operations

You can efficiently perform fundamental set operations, such as combining two
sets together, determining which values two sets have in common, or determining
whether two sets contain all, some, or none of the same values.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fundamental Set Operations

The illustration below depicts two sets‚Äîa and b‚Äîwith the results of various set operations represented by the shaded regions.

image: ../Art/setVennDiagram_2x.png

Use the intersection(_:) method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.
Use the symmetricDifference(_:) method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.
Use the union(_:) method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.
Use the subtracting(_:) method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
// []
oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 9]
oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 2, 9]

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set Membership and Equality

The illustration below depicts three sets‚Äîa, b and c‚Äîwith overlapping regions
representing elements shared among sets. Set a is a superset of set b, because
a contains all elements in b. Conversely, set b is a subset of set a, because
all elements in b are also contained by a. Set b and set c are disjoint with
one another, because they share no elements in common.

image: ../Art/setEulerDiagram_2x.png

Use the ‚Äúis equal‚Äù operator (==) to determine whether two sets contain all of the same values.
Use the isSubset(of:) method to determine whether all of the values of a set are contained in the specified set.
Use the isSuperset(of:) method to determine whether a set contains all of the values in a specified set.
Use the isStrictSubset(of:) or isStrictSuperset(of:) methods to determine whether a set is a subset or superset, but not equal to, a specified set.
Use the isDisjoint(with:) method to determine whether two sets have any values in common.

let houseAnimals: Set = ["üê∂", "üê±"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["üêÆ", "üêî", "üêë", "üê∂", "üê±"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["üê¶", "üê≠"]

houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)
// true



















// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Dictionaries
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary do not have a specified order. You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary is used to look up the definition for a particular word.

NOTE

Swift‚Äôs Dictionary type is bridged to Foundation‚Äôs NSDictionary class.

For more information about using Dictionary with Foundation and Cocoa, see Working with Cocoa Data Types in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 3).

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax

The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as Dictionary<Key, Value>, where Key is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and Value is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.

NOTE

A dictionary Key type must conform to the Hashable protocol, like a set‚Äôs value type.

You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as [Key: Value]. Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred and is used throughout this guide when referring to the type of a dictionary.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating an Empty Dictionary

As with arrays, you can create an empty Dictionary of a certain type by using initializer syntax:

var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
This example creates an empty dictionary of type [Int: String] to store human-readable names of integer values. Its keys are of type Int, and its values are of type String.

If the context already provides type information, you can create an empty dictionary with an empty dictionary literal, which is written as [:] (a colon inside a pair of square brackets):

namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal

You can also initialize a dictionary with a dictionary literal, which has a similar syntax to the array literal seen earlier. A dictionary literal is a shorthand way to write one or more key-value pairs as a Dictionary collection.

A key-value pair is a combination of a key and a value. In a dictionary literal, the key and value in each key-value pair are separated by a colon. The key-value pairs are written as a list, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:

[key 1: value 1, key 2: value 2, key 3: value 3]
The example below creates a dictionary to store the names of international airports. In this dictionary, the keys are three-letter International Air Transport Association codes, and the values are airport names:

var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
The airports dictionary is declared as having a type of [String: String], which means ‚Äúa Dictionary whose keys are of type String, and whose values are also of type String‚Äù.

NOTE

The airports dictionary is declared as a variable (with the var introducer), and not a constant (with the let introducer), because more airports are added to the dictionary in the examples below.

The airports dictionary is initialized with a dictionary literal containing two key-value pairs. The first pair has a key of "YYZ" and a value of "Toronto Pearson". The second pair has a key of "DUB" and a value of "Dublin".

This dictionary literal contains two String: String pairs. This key-value type matches the type of the airports variable declaration (a dictionary with only String keys, and only String values), and so the assignment of the dictionary literal is permitted as a way to initialize the airports dictionary with two initial items.

As with arrays, you don‚Äôt have to write the type of the dictionary if you‚Äôre initializing it with a dictionary literal whose keys and values have consistent types. The initialization of airports could have been written in a shorter form instead:

var airports = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
Because all keys in the literal are of the same type as each other, and likewise all values are of the same type as each other, Swift can infer that [String: String] is the correct type to use for the airports dictionary.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary

You access and modify a dictionary through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.

As with an array, you find out the number of items in a Dictionary by checking its read-only count property:

print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
// Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."

Use the Boolean isEmpty property as a shortcut for checking whether the count property is equal to 0:

if airports.isEmpty {
  print("The airports dictionary is empty.")
} else {
  print("The airports dictionary is not empty.")
}
// Prints "The airports dictionary is not empty."

You can add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax. Use a new key of the appropriate type as the subscript index, and assign a new value of the appropriate type:

airports["LHR"] = "London"
// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items

You can also use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a particular key:

airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"

As an alternative to subscripting, use a dictionary‚Äôs updateValue(_:forKey:) method to set or update the value for a particular key. Like the subscript examples above, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method sets a value for a key if none exists, or updates the value if that key already exists. Unlike a subscript, however, the updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns the old value after performing an update. This enables you to check whether or not an update took place.

The updateValue(_:forKey:) method returns an optional value of the dictionary‚Äôs value type. For a dictionary that stores String values, for example, the method returns a value of type String?, or ‚Äúoptional String‚Äù. This optional value contains the old value for that key if one existed before the update, or nil if no value existed:

if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
  print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."

You can also use subscript syntax to retrieve a value from the dictionary for a particular key. Because it is possible to request a key for which no value exists, a dictionary‚Äôs subscript returns an optional value of the dictionary‚Äôs value type. If the dictionary contains a value for the requested key, the subscript returns an optional value containing the existing value for that key. Otherwise, the subscript returns nil:

if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
  print("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
} else {
  print("That airport is not in the airports dictionary.")
}
// Prints "The name of the airport is Dublin Airport."

You can use subscript syntax to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary by assigning a value of nil for that key:

airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" is not the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary

Alternatively, remove a key-value pair from a dictionary with the removeValue(forKey:) method. This method removes the key-value pair if it exists and returns the removed value, or returns nil if no value existed:

if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
  print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
  print("The airports dictionary does not contain a value for DUB.")
}
// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."
Iterating Over a Dictionary

You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a for-in loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple, and you can decompose the tuple‚Äôs members into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:

for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
  print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
// LHR: London Heathrow
For more about the for-in loop, see For-In Loops.

You can also retrieve an iterable collection of a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values by accessing its keys and values properties:

for airportCode in airports.keys {
  print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: YYZ
// Airport code: LHR

for airportName in airports.values {
  print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
// Airport name: London Heathrow

If you need to use a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values with an API that takes an Array instance, initialize a new array with the keys or values property:

let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["YYZ", "LHR"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["Toronto Pearson", "London Heathrow"]

Swift‚Äôs Dictionary type does not have a defined ordering. To iterate over the keys or values of a dictionary in a specific order, use the sorted() method on its keys or values property.
