# Deep Into The Code

When I discovered [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) a while ago I was inspired by their approach to teaching programming languages.  [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) deserves a mention due to a few similarities but its aim is fundamentally different.

My goal here is to have an ever-evolving compendium of programming language learning materials which emphasize concise but varied code examples.
