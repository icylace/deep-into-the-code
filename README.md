# Deep Into The Code

When I discovered [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) a while ago I was inspired by their approach to presenting programming languages.  There's also [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) which has a few noteworthy similarities but its aim is different.

My goal is to have an ever-evolving compendium of code examples programming language learning materials which emphasize concise but varied code examples.
