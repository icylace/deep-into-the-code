# Deep Into The Code

## A VERY EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS

There exists plenty of quality introductory learning materials available for many programming languages.  They often favor exposition rather than showing huge amounts of code which is understandable.  However, I usually prefer to simply dive deep into the code quickly.

When I found out about [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) a while ago I was inspired by their approach to teaching programming languages.  [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) deserves a mention due to a few similarities but its aim is fundamentally different.

My goal is to have an ever-evolving compendium of programming language learning materials which emphasizes concise but varied code examples.
