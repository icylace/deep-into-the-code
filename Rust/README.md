# Deep Into the Code: Rust (A WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

Based on: [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)

An executable binary file can be generated using the Rust compiler: `rustc`.

```sh
$ rustc hello.rs
# rustc will produce a hello binary that can be executed.
```

```sh
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```
