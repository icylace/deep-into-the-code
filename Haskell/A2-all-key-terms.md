## 001. Comments

* Comment: Text meant to be read by humans and ignored by the compiler.
* Single-line comment: A comment that cannot be on more than one line.
* Block comment: A comment that can extend to multiple consecutive lines.

## 002. Basics of Expressions

* Expression: A combination of terms able to be evaluated together.
* Reducible expression (redex): An expression that can be further simplified.
* Evaluation (reduction): The process of simplifying an expression.
* Normal form: The most simplified, or irreducible, state of an expression.
* Value: An expression in normal form.
* Variable: A placeholder for an expression.
* Declaration: An assignment that binds a variable to an expression.

* Nested expression: An expression embedded within another expression.
* Weak head normal form: A reduced state of an expression.
* Lazy evaluation: The delaying of evaluation until forced to do it.

## 003. Basics of Functions

* Function: An expression that accepts an argument and returns a result.
* Function application: The giving of an argument to a function for evaluation.
* Argument: An input value to the function applied to it.
* Parameter (formal parameter): A variable for an argument to a function.
* Function name: The term for a named function to use during application.
* Function body: The part of the function which gets evaluated.
* Return value: The result of a function evaluation.
* Pure function: A function producing the same output given the same input.

* Currying: Applying a series of nested functions to a series of arguments.
* Partial application: The fixing of arguments to a function to produce another function that takes the remaining unfixed parameters.

## 004. Basics of Operators

* Prefix notation: The placement of a function before its arguments.
* Infix notation: The placement of a function between its arguments.
* Operator: A function with a non-alphanumeric name and infix by default.
* Operand: An argument to an operator.
* Prelude: A library of standard functions.

* Associativity: The way operators are grouped in the absence of parentheses.
* Precedence: The order that similarly-grouped operators are parsed.

* Section: A partial application of an infix function.
* Sectioning: Partially applying an infix function.

## 005. Some Arithmetic

* Unary operator: An operator that applies to a single operand.
* Syntax: The grammar and structure of the text used to express programs.
* Syntactic sugar: Syntax designed to make code easier to read and write.

## 006. `let` and `where`

* Keyword: A term used as a programming language construct.
* Let expression: An expression with declarations introduced into it.
* Scope: The area of a program where a binding of a variable applies.

## 007. Significant Whitespace

* Significant whitespace: Whitespace that helps determine meaning of code.
