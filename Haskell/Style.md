  - notable: "We advise the use of CamelCase for two reasons. First, the report and standard libraries use it, so it helps keep Haskell code consistent. Second, we have just decided on a maximum line length, and the extra character or two saved in an identifier or two can make the difference between a line that simply does not fit nicely in 79 columns, and one that makes it look effortless."

A common Haskell idiom is to use a `go` helper function defined in a `where` clause that can accept more arguments than the function that uses it.
