  <!-- WORK IN PROGRESS -->

  <!-- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) may be embedded within HTML, so that's
    what we've done here in order to simplify what we need to do to see SVG
    in action. -->

  <!-- An SVG element.  Our visuals get rendered within here.  If any of our
    visuals runs up against the edge of our SVG element they'll get clipped. -->
  <svg width="500" height="500">

    <!-- A rectangle.  `x` and `y` specifies where the upper-left corner is. -->
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="50" />

    <!-- A circle.  `cx` and `cy` specifies where the circle centers
      around and `r` specifies the radius. -->
    <circle cx="250" cy="45" r="25" />

    <!-- An ellipse.  Each axis needs a separate radius which is why
      we have `rx` and `ry`. -->
    <ellipse cx="250" cy="125" rx="100" ry="25" />

    <!-- A line.  A stroke color must be defined for the line to be visible. -->
    <line x1="0" y1="0" x2="500" y2="150" stroke="black" />

    <!-- Some text.  `x` specifies where the left edge is and `y`
      specifies where the type's baseline is.  The text element will also
      inherit the CSS font styling of its parent element by default. -->
    <text x="300" y="50">Hello, world!</text>

    <!-- SVG's default style is a black fill with no stroke.  To use a
      different style we'll need to use style properties on our elements. -->

    <!-- Some more text.  Here we override the text formatting inherited
      from the parent element.  We also set the the fill color. -->
    <text x="350" y="105" font-family="sans-serif" font-size="25" fill="gray">Hello, world!</text>

    <!-- Another circle.  This one is pink with a thick purple edge. -->
    <circle cx="225" cy="25" r="22" fill="pink" stroke="purple" stroke-width="5" />

    <!-- We're able to use CSS to help reduce code duplication. -->
    <style>
      /* Though not strictly necessary, explicitly defining our SVG-specific
        classes as descendants of the `svg` element helps avoid confusion as
        to where these classes are intended to be used. */
      svg .pumpkin {
        fill: yellow;
        stroke: orange;
        stroke-width: 5px;
      }
   </style>

    <!-- Here we have a circle and rectangle that share the same style. -->
    <circle class="pumpkin" cx="75" cy="325" r="22" />
    <rect class="pumpkin" x="140" y="200" width="100" height="10" />

    <!-- SVG doesn't have a "layers" concept.  Instead, the order in which SVG
      elements get rendered determines which ones are on top of others.  The
      first element may be obscured by the second element which in turn may
      be obscured by the third element and so on. -->

    <!-- A series of overlapping rectangles. -->
    <rect x="100" y="80" width="30" height="30" fill="purple" />
    <rect x="120" y="85" width="30" height="30" fill="blue" />
    <rect x="140" y="90" width="30" height="30" fill="green" />

    <rect x="180" y="100" width="30" height="30" fill="red" />

      that are at different transparencies. -->
